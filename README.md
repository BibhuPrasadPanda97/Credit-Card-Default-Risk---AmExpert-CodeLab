Evaluation Metrics is:
*score: 100*(metrics.f1_score(actual, predicted, average="macro"))*

#### We got the scores from each of the model as given below:
1. <i>Logistic Regression:</i> 84.85652
2. <i>Random Forest:</i> 89.27377
3. <i>Artificial Neural Networks:</i> 87.46621
4. <i>XGBoost Model:</i> 91.15589
